# litevex's stuff
Hi, I'm litevex and I've made several Unity C# projects. I also have some pretty good knowledge of JS and CSS. Most of the things I've made are listed on here, just in case I'll ever need a full list of everything I made.

## Project RNG3D
Procedurally generated platformer made in C# and Unity, started development initially several months ago and has evolved over time as I was slowly working on it a couple of times with several stages of art styles, ending up with the retro prototype you see now. Each level, different platforms are procedurally generated, all of which have a different effect. It's much more fun than it might look, and I've probably spent several hours just playing it casually. Development is currently on hold, but I'm planning to port it over to s&box as a multiplayer game once s&box releases.

## [Fyubits](https://domenicw.itch.io/fyubits)
        
Fyubits is a puzzle game made in the span of a few days for a game jam. It's an atmospheric puzzle game involving freezing your point of view and dragging around cubes in your current 2D perspective. For this game, I chose "Prototype" as the art style. Because of the time limitation, I didn't really add that many puzzles, but I still think it's worth playing.

## [Unibox](https://domenicw.itch.io/unibox)
Unibox is a Garry's Mod like sandbox game made in Unity. It features a resizer, welder, gun, spawner, a working physics gun and a spawn menu with dynamically generated thumbnails. It got about 200 downloads after publishing it on my itch.io page. I never really finished it, but it's still cool I guess.

## [Windows 94](https://windows94.net)
I was the team leader and branding designer on a fan-made javascript modification of the popular website [windows93.net](http://windows93.net/). The project was called Windows 94 and had about 8 people working on it. I was also assigned to creating the CSS part of this project.

Here's the branding material for the part of Windows 94 that I worked on.

I've also made the branding material for all other parts of Windows 94. Here's a couple of samples.

## [Windows 93 Documentation](https://windows93.net/docs)
I made the partially official documentation for all the Javascript APIs in Windows93.net, which is now up on the website. It was made using mkdocs as a static documentation generator. (disclaimer: I am not associated with Windows93). You can see it here: [http://windows93.net/docs](http://windows93.net/docs).

## Blender Stuff
The last couple of years I've been making stuff in Blender sometimes. Here's some of my work. A lot of it is pretty early or made as a joke and I didn't really get around to finishing most of it.

## WebNESCorrupt
Website powered by Node.JS that lets you corrupt classic NES roms right in your browser by stacking several game genie codes. It's currently not public.

## VR Kitchen
Early VR cooking simulator project. The game itself doesn't have much yet, but there is a lot of planning done for it already. I'm planning to finish it by next year.

## Windows 90
Online recreation of Windows 95. It didn't get very far, but I still think it's worth showing. The design here is completely taken from Windows93.net because of how early this is, but the code was made by me.
